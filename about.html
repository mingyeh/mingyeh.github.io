    <h3>Working Experience</h3>

    <p><strong>Jun 2017 ~ Current:</strong> <a href="http://www.volvo.com">Volvo IT</a></p>
    <p>
    I am working as Technical Specialist in DealerPoint Team. We are responsible to develop and maintain an application system used for truck sales in over 50 countries. The application system is developed with ASP.net and SQL Server, but we are attemping to migrate it to Angular platform.<br/>
    The job is quite challenging, but I learn quite a lot from it with my fantastic, creative and energic team collegues.  
    </p>

    <p><strong>Oct 2012 ~ May 2017:</strong> <a href="http://www.nnit.com">NNIT</a></p>
    <p>
    I worked as Technical Consultant in RIMS team. We were responsible to maintain a global application system used for pharmaceutical registrations. The application is developed by vendor, and based on Java and Oracle. <br/> 
    The job was not quite challenging in techniques, but I learned more in software documentation and validation in GxP related works.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Jan 2007 ~ Oct 2012:</strong> <a href="http://www.teda-reform.cn/">TEDA Reform Technology Co., Ltd</a></p>
    <p>
    I worked as Deputy Manager in Software Development Department. The most successful application system we developed is Labouratory Data Analysis System deployed in TEDA Veolia Sewage Treatment Plant, which involves linear analysis and normal distribution analysis.

    </p>

    <p><strong>Oct 2004 ~ Oct 2006:</strong> <a href="http://www.aidianfood.com/">TPFTZ Aixin Foodstuffs Co., Ltd</a></p>
    <p>
    I worked as e-Commerce Specialist in e-Business Department. My daily works are publishing business trend in Alibaba.com and maintaining websites. It was a quite different territory comparing to previous working experience, but it was quite good to get an oppotunity to get a view from another point.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Feb 2004 ~ Oct 2004:</strong> Tianjin Intelligent Ship Technology Co., Ltd</p>
    <p>
    I worked as Developer in Software Development Department and responsible to develop and maintain an ERP system designed for COSCO vessel repairing yards. I spent most of the time in a shipyard in Nantong city. The system was developed with PowerBuilder, well, that is not my cup of tea :)
    </p>

    <p><strong>Jun 2002 ~ Feb 2004:</strong> <a href="http://www.supermap.com/">SuperMap Software Co., Ltd.</a></p>
    <p>
    It was my first job after graduation. I worked as Developer in DigitalLand Department. I was responsible to develop and maintain several OA systems designed for Bureau of Land and Resources, which were based on ASP and SQL Server.
    I'm quite appreciated for the experience in SuperMap. I learned a lot from my leaders and collegues, not only the techniques, but also the ambition and contributing attitude.
